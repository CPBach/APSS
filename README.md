Another plate solving software - Identify stars in the nightsky

The goal of this project is to have a Java-Open-source plate solving software,
like already existing with astrometry.net.

As it stands, we only support loading the Yale bright star catalogue and basic
quad operations.

Feel free to contact me if you wish to contribute to this.
