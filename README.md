**APSS - Another plate solving software** is a Java program to identify the stars in the nightsky by given pictures shot with dslr's or telescopes.

The goal of this project is to have a Java-Open-source plate solving software,
like already existing with astrometry.net.

As it stands, we only support loading the Yale bright star catalogue and basic
quad operations.

Feel free to contact me if you wish to contribute to this.
